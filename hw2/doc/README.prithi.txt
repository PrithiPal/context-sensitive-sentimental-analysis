1. Read research papers on “Improved Decipherment of Homophonic Ciphers”, “Beam Search for Solving Substitution Ciphers” and “Decipherment of Substitution Ciphers with Neural Language Models”

2. After reading papers, following Coursys discussion, prepared an outline to summarise the tasks needs to be done (README.md)

3. Wrote the beam search algorithm with beam_width=1 (best first search only)
	- Josh implemented once again to re-confirm that we are on right track 
	- Ekam helped with going through the process.

4. Studied the ngram scores (from ngram.py) and implemented the maximum context score. Added to the beam search function.

5. Implemented Beam search for multiple beam width (taking 2nd best, 3rd best ..)

6. Planned and wrote code for evaluating the beam search results for ngrams and neural (Ekam scored beam search using neurals). 

7. Beautify the notebook with adequate comments and illustrations. Also provide the best output (13%) for cipher (partial)
