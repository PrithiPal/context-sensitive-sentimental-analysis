## WORD ALIGNMENT ASSIGNMENT


The align.ipynb, align.py , europarl_align.a are in the answer directory. Same files are in the home directory. 


Other Files : 
best_model.p : Pickle version of Model  Params (t dictionary with weights)
dice.a : Alignment for the last files ran on Model (Deutch-English as of this commit)

NOTE : I am removing the Pickle version because I ran on 10 iteration and it is huge, to reobtain the file, please refer to the align.ipynb or run align.py
